         <h2> Courage and Strength</h2>
         <p>We have many possibilities to explore and achieve, but we also encounter many difficulties, some of them specific to our era. We live in a world where moral standards have been largely ignored, where sin is openly displayed, and where we are constantly tempted to deviate from the straight and narrow path. 
            We are faced with relentless pressures and harmful influences that undermine what is good and try to replace it with the superficial philosophies and practices of a secular society.
            We may face many trials, pains, and hard choices in life. But even in the midst of adversity, the Lord tells us to be brave and confident. We can learn from Joshua 1:9 in the Bible how to face difficult things with faith and courage.
            <br>
            <h2>Joshua’s challenges</h2>
The children of Israel had wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and it was up to Joshua to lead them into the promised land. He’d have to claim the land from its current inhabitants, fight and lead battles, and provide spiritual leadership for a large group of people. 
As he was feeling the overwhelming weight of the task before him, the Lord offered these words of encouragement:
<br>
Being strong and courageous means relying on the Lord as our true source of strength. 
Joshua did not know how to overcome the challenges he faced. 
But he was told to move forward anyway, acting in faith. 
Like Joshua, we often do not know how to deal with our personal challenges. 
But God promises that when we seek His guidance, we will succeed. God is all-powerful and all-knowing. 
He has the solutions and the strength we need to face any challenge we encounter. 
He was with Joshua, and He will be with us.
<br>
<br>
“Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: <br>for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”
Joshua 1:9.”

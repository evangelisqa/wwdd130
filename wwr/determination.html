    <p><b>Having Faith In the Lord</b></p>
    <p>Hope, faith, gratitude and love are four powerful words that can transform our lives.
        Hope is the belief that things will get better, that we can overcome any challenge, and that we have a purpose
        in this world.
        Faith is the trust that we are not alone, that there is a higher power that guides us, and that we can achieve
        our goals.
        Gratitude is the appreciation for what we have, for the people who support us, and for the opportunities that
        come our way.
        Love is the feeling of connection, compassion, and kindness that we share with ourselves and others.
        Together, these four words can inspire us to live with joy, peace, and happiness.
        They can help us cope with stress, adversity, and uncertainty. They can motivate us to grow, learn, and serve.
        They can make us more resilient, optimistic, and generous.
        Hope, faith, gratitude and love are not just words, they are the essence of our existence.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>Hope has the capacity to bring happiness into our lives. Through despair, we are kept afloat by hope. The
        same method we learn to walk—one step at a time—is how we create hope. As we more fully embody the gospel, we
        become more capable of "abounding in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."
        <br>A perfect example of the power of hope is the story of King Lamoni's father in the Book of Mormon.
        He didn't even know if there was a God. But with a sense of hope he prayed, “If there is a God, and if thou art
        God,
        wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee” (Alma 22:18).

    <h2> He Loves Us</h2>
    <p>One of the ways we can show our love for God and others is by expressing our gratitude for the gifts and
        kindnesses they give us. God has promised that if we are thankful for everything He gives us, He will make us
        glorious (Doctrine and Covenants 78:19). Gratitude is a positive and uplifting attitude that elevates us.

        You can show your faith in the Lord by having a hope that you will receive eternal life and by keeping the love
        of God always in your heart (Alma 13:28–29).

        The Bible teaches us that faith is the assurance of what we hope for and the evidence of what we do not see.
        Hope is the expectation of something good happening in the future. The Word tells us to put our hope in the
        Lord, the Word tells us God has plans to give us hope and a future (Jeremiah 29:11).

        I think the Lord wants me to tell you that we should not be afraid, but trust in God and the power of the
        Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. Remember that Jesus Christ—the One who made the universe, the One who
        planned our salvation, and the One who leads this Church —is in charge. Hope can make our lives joyful. But when
        our hope is delayed, our heart can become sad.-

        Because of Christ there is hope smiling brightly before you, and you need not worry too much about sickness,
        death, poverty, or other afflictions. The Lord will take care of you. Your responsibility is to keep the
        commandments, feast upon the words of Christ, and stay in the path to your heavenly home.”

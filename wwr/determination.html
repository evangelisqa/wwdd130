    <p><b>I Chose To Serve</b></p>
    <p>My spirit is revived as I worked in the temple. The pure doctrine becomes more evident than ever.
        The temple is essential for my earthly progress. I can draw nearer to God by enhancing my temple service. The temple can renew me and my witness of Him.
        I’m so grateful to my Savior for giving me the desire to serve in His holy house and to strive to be like him.
        <br>
        <br>
         It’s my favourite place where I can feel that Jesus Christ is my reliever in every difficult time of my life. 
        I feel peace and comfort and of course every Sunday, as I renew my covenants I feel the love and the power of the atonement of Jesus Christ.
        Even before I was endowed, Heavenly Father knew I had a burning desire to enter the house of the Lord to feel closer to Him. I joined the church in 2008 in Taiwan and I received my endowment in the Regina Saskatchewan Temple in 2015. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Since then, I have made it a goal and priority to attend the temple regularly. By taking the time and making the sacrifices necessary to be closer to my Heavenly Father in His holy house,  
         I always focus on my blessings, not the problems. I have a deeper comprehension now than ever before, that my Heavenly Father cherishes me. He loves me with a love that is beyond my imagination. And when I experience that love more fully, 
        it’s very soothing, and it brings a lot of tranquility. I know He looks after the one. I know that He is familiar with me so closely, and He arranges my interactions in ways that are truly amazing if I pay attention. Sometimes it’s so subtle that I miss it. 
        But He demonstrate His love and grace with me constantly. I just need to be mindful of it, I need to seek it.
      <br>
      <br>
        The song "Strength Beyond My Own" resonates with me deeply. It captures the emotion I have in the temple. My service in the temple 
        has brought me great peace and friendship. I have met many wonderful people there,
        some of whom are my best friends.

    <h2> He Loves Us</h2>
    <p>One of the ways we can show our love for God and others is by expressing our gratitude for the gifts and
        kindnesses they give us. God has promised that if we are thankful for everything He gives us, He will make us
        glorious (Doctrine and Covenants 78:19). Gratitude is a positive and uplifting attitude that elevates us.
       <br>
       <br>
        You can show your faith in the Lord by having a hope that you will receive eternal life and by keeping the love
        of God always in your heart (Alma 13:28–29).
        The Bible teaches us that faith is the assurance of what we hope for and the evidence of what we do not see.
        Hope is the expectation of something good happening in the future. The Word tells us to put our hope in the
        Lord, the Word tells us God has plans to give us hope and a future."For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, straight
        the Lord, thought of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end" (Jeremiah 29:11).
       <br>
       <br>
        God does know and love us. His love for us and for our father in Heaven is pure and eternal.
        To focus on the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ for all, 
        which is manifest through the atonment of Jesus Christ. 
        "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son" (John 3:16).
        
       <br>
       <br>
        Because of Christ there is hope smiling brightly before you, and you need not worry too much about sickness,
        death, poverty, or other afflictions. The Lord will take care of you. Your responsibility is to keep the
        commandments, feast upon the words of Christ, and stay in the path to your heavenly home.”

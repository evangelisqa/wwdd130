            encouraging and motivational words. If you feel like there's no more hope left you, read these encouraging
            words.
            God knows you. He knows your effort and loves you for it. He just asks you to return and keep on returning.
            He will gladly work with you for as long as you're on the road. No matter what's making you feel down, know

        <h4>CHEERFULNESS</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here’s your heartening word to restore yourself of what matters most! You may feel life is overwhelming, but
            don’t ever give up! Jesus is rooting for you.Whether you're having a rough day and need some motivation to
            assure yourself that it's all going to be OK, or you're just looking for a mission statement for the day,
            these kind words will help you put one foot in front of the other and make the small or sweeping changes
            that you desire. Always remember sometimes just reminding yourself of the temporality of failure enables you
            to forge ahead.
        <br>   
        <br>
        No matter how strong our resolve, sometimes we get frustrated and want to give up—whether that happens at
            work, training for a big race, or even a relationship. Those are the times when we most need some
            encouragement—that could be a pep talk or reading just the right encouragement.
            We got you! It's time to get channel your inner Rocky, get the eye of the tiger, and embrace these
            delightful messages about the importance of never giving up!
            Motivational source can help you reach your potential each day. Sure, they’re just words. But they’re
            positive words. And if you’re on the verge of giving up or struggling to push yourself to the next level,
            sometimes that’s just what you need.
            So, let’s dive into what motivation is, how to inspire yourself, and the motivational keys that’ll get you
            back on track. These motivational ways will give your day the jumpstart it needs, so don’t forget to
            bookmark this page. 
            I recommend writing down some of the best inspirational and motivational experience that resonate with you
            and your current situation. After writing them down, find the most motivational thought or the most
            inspiring passage, read it out loud, and then really try to understand the meaning. 
        <br>
        <br>
      Music for me is another way to uplift my spirit. When you feel discouraged or helpless and don’t feel like
            discussing it with anyone, finding comfort in motivational songs becomes necessary. While sometimes you just
            need the inspiration to reach your goals, songs also provide an emotional lift to a goalless life. Life is a
            beautiful journey that is meant to be embraced to the fullest every day. However, that doesn't mean you
            always wake up ready to seize the day, and sometimes need a reminder that life is a great gift.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>DETERMINATION</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A happiness passage a day can help you live a life with more play. On days where you need some more joy,
            reading about happiness can uplift you. We’re all trying to find happy moments in our life. But happiness is
            always there when you live presently. When we stop drowning our thoughts in the past and fearing the future,
            we can find peace in the present. We hope these messages brighten up your day. </p>

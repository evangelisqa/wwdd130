        CHEERFULNESS
        <br>
        <br>
        Here’s your heartening word to restore yourself of what matters most! You may feel life is overwhelming, but
        don’t ever give up! Jesus is rooting for you.Whether you're having a rough day and need some motivation to
        assure yourself that it's all going to be OK, or you're just looking for a mission statement for the day,
        these kind words will help you put one foot in front of the other and make the small or sweeping changes
        that you desire. Always remember sometimes just reminding yourself of the temporality of failure enables you
        to forge ahead.
        <br>
        No matter how strong our resolve, sometimes we get frustrated and want to give up—whether that happens at
        work, training for a big race, or even a relationship. Those are the times when we most need some
        encouragement—that could be a pep talk or reading just the right encouragement.
        We got you! It's time to get channel your inner Rocky, get the eye of the tiger, and embrace these
        delightful messages about the importance of never giving up!
        Motivational source can help you reach your potential each day. Sure, they’re just words. But they’re
        positive words. And if you’re on the verge of giving up or struggling to push yourself to the next level,
        sometimes that’s just what you need.
        So, let’s dive into what motivation is, how to inspire yourself, and the motivational keys that’ll get you
        back on track. These motivational ways will give your day the jumpstart it needs, so don’t forget to
        bookmark this page. 
        I recommend writing down some of the best inspirational and motivational experience that resonate with you
        and your current situation. After writing them down, find the most motivational thought or the most
        inspiring passage, read it out loud, and then really try to understand the meaning. 
        <br>
        Music for me is another way to uplift my spirit. When you feel discouraged or helpless and don’t feel like
        discussing it with anyone, finding comfort in motivational songs becomes necessary. While sometimes you just
        need the inspiration to reach your goals, songs also provide an emotional lift to a goalless life. Life is a
        beautiful journey that is meant to be embraced to the fullest every day. However, that doesn't mean you
        always wake up ready to seize the day, and sometimes need a reminder that life is a great gift.
        <br>
        <br>
        DETERMINATION
        <br>
        <br>
        A happiness passage a day can help you live a life with more play. On days where you need some more joy,
        reading about happiness can uplift you. We’re all trying to find happy moments in our life. But happiness is
        always there when you live presently. When we stop drowning our thoughts in the past and fearing the future,
        we can find peace in the present. We hope these messages brighten up your day.

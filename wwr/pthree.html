        <p><b>Having Faith On the lord</b></p>
        <p>Hope, faith, gratitude and love are four powerful words that can transform our lives. 
            Hope is the belief that things will get better, that we can overcome any challenge, and that we have a purpose in this world. 
            Faith is the trust that we are not alone, that there is a higher power that guides us, and that we can achieve our goals. 
            Gratitude is the appreciation for what we have, for the people who support us, and for the opportunities that come our way.
             Love is the feeling of connection, compassion, and kindness that we share with ourselves and others. 
             Together, these four words can inspire us to live with joy, peace, and happiness. 
             They can help us cope with stress, adversity, and uncertainty. They can motivate us to grow, learn, and serve. 
             They can make us more resilient, optimistic, and generous.
             Hope, faith, gratitude and love are not just words, they are the essence of our existence.</p>

            <h2> He Loves Us</h2>
            One of the ways we can show our love for God and others is by expressing our gratitude for the gifts and kindnesses they give us. God has promised that if we are thankful for everything He gives us, He will make us glorious (Doctrine and Covenants 78:19). Gratitude is a positive and uplifting attitude that elevates us.

                You can show your faith in the Lord by having a hope that you will receive eternal life and by keeping the love of God always in your heart (Alma 13:28–29).
                
                The Bible teaches us that faith is the assurance of what we hope for and the evidence of what we do not see. Hope is the expectation of something good happening in the future. The Word tells us to put our hope in the Lord, the Word tells us God has plans to give us hope and a future (Jeremiah 29:11).
                
                I think the Lord wants me to tell you that we should not be afraid, but trust in God and the power of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. Remember that Jesus Christ—the One who made the universe, the One who planned our salvation, and the One who leads this Church —is in charge. Hope can make our lives joyful. But when our hope is delayed, our heart can become sad.-
                
                Because of Christ there is hope smiling brightly before you, and you need not worry too much about sickness, death, poverty, or other afflictions. The Lord will take care of you. Your responsibility is to keep the commandments, feast upon the words of Christ, and stay in the path to your heavenly home.”
